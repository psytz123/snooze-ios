## Subscriptions & Payments

### How Payments Work

Snooze Pro subscriptions are processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. When you subscribe:

1. You authorize payment through your Apple ID
2. Apple processes the transaction
3. Apple notifies our app that you have an active subscription
4. We do **not** receive your payment details, credit card information, or Apple ID

### What We Receive from Apple

We receive only:
- Confirmation that a valid subscription exists
- Subscription status (active, expired, cancelled)

We do **not** receive:
- Your name or email
- Payment method details
- Apple ID information
- Transaction history

### Managing Your Subscription

To manage or cancel your subscription:
1. Open **Settings** on your iPhone
2. Tap your name at the top
3. Tap **Subscriptions**
4. Select **Snooze Pro**
5. Choose to modify or cancel

## Local Notifications

Snooze uses local notifications to remind you at your scheduled times.

- Notifications are scheduled and delivered entirely by iOS
- Notification content (your reminder text) never leaves your device
- We do not use push notifications from external servers
- We do not collect notification interaction data

## Third-Party Services

Snooze does **not** integrate with any third-party services:

- ❌ No analytics (Google Analytics, Firebase, Mixpanel, etc.)
- ❌ No advertising SDKs

- ❌ No social media integrations

## Data Security

Since we don't collect your data, there's no data to secure on our end.

For data stored on your device:
- iOS provides encryption at rest
- Your device passcode/Face ID/Touch ID protects access
- SwiftData (Apple's framework) handles local storage securely

---

## Children's Privacy

Snooze does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. The app contains no features that require personal information and is safe for users of all ages.

---

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Changes will be posted here with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the new policy.

Since we don't collect your email, we cannot notify you of changes directly. We recommend reviewing this policy periodically.

## Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction (GDPR, CCPA, etc.), you may have rights regarding your personal data. Since Snooze does not collect personal data:

- **Right to Access**: There is no data to access
- **Right to Deletion**: Local data can be deleted by uninstalling the app
- **Right to Portability**: Data is stored locally; export by backing up your device
- **Right to Opt-Out**: No data collection means nothing to opt out of
