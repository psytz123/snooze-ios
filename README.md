# Snooze Subscription Skeleton

This is a minimal Xcode-ready skeleton for the Snooze app with:
- Snooze bar UI
- Reminder model and store
- Local notification handling
- Basic StoreKit 2 subscription manager
- Free-vs-paid gating (10 free snoozes/day)
- Paywall and Settings views

## Usage

1. Create a new iOS App project in Xcode named "Snooze".
2. Drag the contents of this folder into the Xcode project (copy files if needed).
3. Replace the default `SnoozeApp.swift` with the one in this skeleton.
4. Set your real subscription product ID in `SubscriptionManager.swift`.
5. Configure In-App Purchase in App Store Connect.
6. Build and run on a simulator or device.

This skeleton is not production-ready but provides a strong starting point.
